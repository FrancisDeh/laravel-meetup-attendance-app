# laravel-meetup-attendance-app
A sample Laravel + Bootstrap app that registers members who attend a meetup for a period of days.
This project was built by a team of three.

Attendance App registers users who 
come for a meetup the first time.
Subsequent days, the app allows members to be
checked as present.
MySql database is used to store the details whiles
the interface uses Bootstrap.
Members can be displayed based on date of attendance and 
simple statistics generated based on date and location.

"Screenshots folder".
